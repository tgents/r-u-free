This was a hackathon project for DubHacks. The idea was to create an application that allowed users basically tell their friends that "I am free right now! Anyone want to do something?" with a switch. Once they turn on the "I am free" switch, their friends will see that their status has been updated. This used Firebase to keep track of the people's statuses.

This is the web app repo, for the android app repo go here: https://github.com/neonrights/ImFree
